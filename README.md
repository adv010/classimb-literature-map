Collecting a list of papers here that I came across during my thesis. Extensive notes from my Mendeley to be imported here in the future. Mix of insights from 3D backbones for Object Detection & SSL/SSDA/UDA approaches for 3D SSOD.

1. BADet : **Boundary-Aware 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds**
Insight - _During proposal generation, proposals produced do not align well with the GTs. Plus, authors propose to consider the proposals not as independent, but as spatially correlated with each other by trating these correlations using a Graph, using a GNN to learn the neighborhood_
Interest areas - Region Feature Aggregation Module :How do they capture the features?
